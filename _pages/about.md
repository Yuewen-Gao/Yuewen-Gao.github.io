<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
! My name is **Yuewen Gao**. I'm currently a junior at School of Intelligence Science and Technology, <a href='nju.edu.cn'>Nanjing University (NJU)</a>. I'm fortunate to be supervised by <a href='https://lukexuke.github.io/'>Prof. Ke Xu</a>, and mentored by <a href='https://wenchao.li/#about_me'>Dr. Wenchao Li</a>. .

My research interest lies, broadly, in **Human-AI Collaboration**, **Visualization**, **Computational Interaction**, aiming to enhance human welfare through technology. I bridge the gap between human cognition and machine intelligence through two pillars:

- **Empirical Understanding of Human Cognition**: I conduct empirical studies and experiments to uncover how humans perceive information and express creativity, establishing a psychological foundation for AI collaboration.
- **Human-Centric AI & Computational Interaction**: I develop generative and interactive systems that understand human intent and augment user agency in complex creative tasks.

I'm actively seeking potential research internship opportunity in the United States, Singapore and Hong Kong. If my background aligns with your interests or if you have positions for **Summer Research Intern 2026** or any interesting topics, I would be very happy to connect. Feel free to reach out to me, let's go together to **Make the Impossible Possible and the Possible Easy.**
